# LabyrinthOfGrindmur
<p>A turn-based roguelike maze runner against an AI-driven enemy.</p>
<p>Based on the classic roguelike <a href="http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/">tutorial</a> and tailored for maze generation and AI maze solving.</p>

<p>The player has to solve the maze with limited visibility (Field of View) before the rival AI finds a way out of the same maze. However, the player is able to see the full enemy's map.</p>
<p>The mazes are identical and have traps as well as buffs, which affect movement speed. Difficulty levels affect the chance of their spawning.</p>
<p>The game itself is turn-based, like most classic roguelikes.</p>
